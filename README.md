C# Graphics engine using GDI

I took the messy code from the LD31 game I made and turned it into an engine. Based of GDI and GDI+ - Nothing too fancy.

The aim is that the engine will hold all the files and do all the logic for the majority of the game. Just change the file references and have fun!
